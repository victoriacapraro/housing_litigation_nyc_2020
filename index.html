        It's the middle of winter. Your building doesn't have heat for weeks. You try to contact your landlord, but they don't do anything to help you. What do you do?
        <br><br>
        Some New Yorkers take their landlord to court.
        <br><br>
        According to data from the Housing Litigation Division, tenants in The Bronx had more cases against their landlords in 2020 than any other Borough. East Brooklyn also had a high concentration of cases.
        <br><br>
        Most cases claim harassment, building disrepair, or loss of access to heat and hot water utilities.

        The neighborhoods with the most cases are also the neighborhoods with the highest density of Black and Latino people. They also tend to be the neighborhoods where rent and income are lowest.
        <br><br>
        The majority of claims brought to suit in 2020 were categorized as "Tenant Action," meaning that likely a group of tenants came together in court against their landlord. The data can indicate the communities where buildings are in disrepair,
        or where landlords neglect tenant needs such as heat and hot water.
        <br><br>
        According to the Housing Litigation Division, the suits are meant to enforce compliance with the housing quality standards contained in the NYS Multiple Dwelling Law and NYC Housing Maintenance Code.
